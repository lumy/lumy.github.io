<h2>Hunting</h2>
<p>Just a few word to talk about the time and the few idea that I had while looking for the van.
I&#8217;ve been thinking about buying a van for few years now, i was waiting the right time and the motivation.
And it came just at the beginning of summer, and i had a crazy summer so no time to look before october.
<a href="#bad-idea">What a wrong time !</a> but i seriously start looking for it and saw alot of different models.
One of my first thought was buying an old horses van, it would have space, alot, probably wouldn&#8217;t be so
expensive and would probably have a great engine. What was my thought based on ? Probably the idea that
most of horse rider have money and take care of the van where there horses are&nbsp;travelling.</p>
<p>Well it&#8217;s probably mostly true but it was expensive, i finally saw one not so far and in my range of price,
but the engine was in bad state, it took us 40 minute just to start the engine. From the same year I was born
this van didn&#8217;t have power steering. Very hard to drive, and smelling so much. I though myself that it was probably
not a good&nbsp;idea.</p>
<p>So I started to look for a van like this
<img alt="camion caisse" class="figures " src="https://blog.lumy.me/images/van/camion_caisse.jpg" style="max-width: 70%; height: auto; float: right; "></p>
<p>My though was that i wouldn&#8217;t have trouble with the isolation around the wheel, i would be able to move the container if it&#8217;s well kept.
The prices were a little higher that what i was looking for, otherwise it was a little too old for me and I would have more space to arrange inside but it would take more time than a simple&nbsp;van.</p>
<p>It was decided it would be something really close to an <span class="caps">L2H2</span>. stay <a href="/tag/python"><span class="caps">KISS</span> for now (Keep it simple and&nbsp;stupid).</a></p>
<p>And I found this van, it was a cute one, had already lived (288000km) and had alot of maintenance&#8217;s bill for the last 10 years;
I though that was a good sign and I said yes.
<img alt="camion caisse" class="figures " src="https://blog.lumy.me/images/van/camion_caisse.jpg" style="max-width: 40%; height: auto; float: right; ">
There was a missunderstood between the seller and me, and while I was going to <a href="juggling/jongle-en-zik">a little juggling convention near Avignon (France)</a>,
I almost did not got the van (which would have been better !), but i finally managed to buy it on a monday&nbsp;evening.</p>
<div id="gotit"></div>

<h1>Got the&nbsp;van</h1>
<p>After weeks <strong>hunting</strong> the perfect van, I finally found one.
Well we&#8217;re far from the perfect, I was tired and really wanted to start.
<a href="#bad-idea">That was not the best idea I&#8217;ve ever&nbsp;had.</a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a Renault Master <span class="caps">L2H2</span>, the engine seems in relative good state but i wouldn&#8217;t be
a bad idea to run a <a href="/van/engine">check by a professional</a>.</p>
<p>It was sold with some plank, a bedspring and some multilayer isolation.
The seller already had put the floor and some isolation under.
<img alt="Van" class="figures " src="https://blog.lumy.me/images/van/van_inside.jpg" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; "></p>
<p>The sheet metal it&#8217;s another story, i didn&#8217;t really check well and I didn&#8217;t saw all the&nbsp;rust.</p>
<div id="rust"></div>

<h1>The&nbsp;Rust</h1>
<p>I’ve discovered the rust hidden under putty and some weird&nbsp;resin.</p>
<p><img alt="Van" class="figures " src="https://blog.lumy.me/images/van/rust2.jpg" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; ">
The weird resin very hard to remove, on the top of the&nbsp;van,</p>
<p>And what a surprise, or not, i discovered under the shitty&nbsp;stuff.</p>
<p><img alt="Van" class="figures " src="https://blog.lumy.me/images/van/rust.jpg" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; "></p>
<p>So i started to list what i had to do before being able to work on the inside&nbsp;part:</p>
<ul>
<li>i&#8217;ve to sand every part that as serious rust on it of:<ul>
<li>the&nbsp;top.</li>
<li>the&nbsp;side.</li>
<li>the doors&nbsp;inside/outside.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>put some product for the&nbsp;rust.</li>
<li>fix the hole with epoxy and glass&nbsp;fiber.</li>
<li>paint every worked&nbsp;parts.</li>
<li>change all&nbsp;lock.</li>
<li>repair the middle door that open with&nbsp;difficulty.</li>
<li>repair the broken door&nbsp;handle.</li>
<li>check what is under the floor what isolation and what state is the steel&nbsp;sheets.</li>
</ul>
<p>See you for <a href="/van/rust/">day one of work!</a> <a href="#bad-idea">(Unless you want to see a <span class="caps">NOT</span>-<span class="caps">TO</span>-<span class="caps">DO</span>&nbsp;list)</a></p>
<div id="bad-idea"></div>

<h2>Bad&nbsp;Idea</h2>
<p>There I&#8217;ll list few stuff you should keep in mind / do while looking for a van.
I don&#8217;t pretend that will make you buy the perfect van, neither you won&#8217;t do any mistake. But if i can help by sharing my&nbsp;mistakes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span class="caps">DO</span> <span class="caps">NOT</span></strong> start looking for a van you will work on at the beginning of winter (unless you have a closed place). I&#8217;m suffering to work on cold days and i can&#8217;t work more than 8h (let&#8217;s be honest it&#8217;s around 5h in the good day), the sunset is too early and it&#8217;s not gonna get better before few&nbsp;months.</li>
<li>If you can have a covered place to work it make it way easier (you can avoid weather trouble specially if you have rust on your van&nbsp;!).</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t rush. Neither you or the seller should be in a rush. Even if the seller has some important money&nbsp;deadline.</li>
<li>Try every door yourself. If the seller show you something, do the same manipulation just after him, verify you can do it as well and&nbsp;easily.</li>
<li>If something on the steel sheets seems weird, grind it with something just a little. you could discover some pretty good shit (soon some picture of a friend&#8217;s&nbsp;van).</li>
<li>check the top of the van. It&#8217;s not easy access but find a way to climb and check&nbsp;!</li>
</ul>
<p>If I find anything new to add to the list I&#8217;ll (before the end of the work it might even be a post about what not to do during the whole process of buying and working on the&nbsp;van).</p>
