# Got the van

After weeks hunting the perfect van, I finally found one.
Well we're far from the perfect, I was tired and really wanted to start.
![Van]({static}/images/van_back.jpg){class="figures " }

<div class="figure" style="width: 200px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;">
<img alt="A dummy placeholder image, 200x200 pixels square." src="http://duncanlock.net/images/posts/better-figures-images-plugin-for-pelican/dummy-200x200.png" style="width: 200px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;">
<p class="caption">This image is only 200px wide - smaller that the column it’s&nbsp;in.</p>
<div class="legend">
The max-width: 100% doesn’t stretch the image, because it’s also got a width: 200px - making it shrink to fit.</div>
</div>

It's a Renault Master L2H2, the engine seems in relative good state but i wouldn't be
a bad idea to run a check by a professional.

The sheet metal it's another story, i didn't really check well and I didn't saw all the rust.
