# The tools for the rust

at the end of the article i'll give some mistake i've learn from.

First of all i never had any toolbox, direction the shop to buy a toolbox and fill it with tools i'll need.

- Sandpaper (or better some [emerie tissue](https://www.leroymerlin.fr/v3/p/produits/toile-emeri-e1500118817))
- cutter
- files
- spatula

I started to sand every part. inside and outside. and soon it started to look better.

Then i should have put some product to transform the rest of rust into another chemical entity, that i could clean. 
Treat the metal sheets and cover them.

But, the bad weathers, my work taking too much time,  I didn't find the right time to do it.
The weather got worst and it had been raining too much the last day.
Weather reports says it's gonna be better on monday i'll do everything at one.
I covered my van trying to protect the metal sheet from the rain,

It probably helped a little but not that much, and i'd look at it today,

I'm not back at square 0 but i'll have to sand a little every part before going for the product.

# Finally getting result ?
