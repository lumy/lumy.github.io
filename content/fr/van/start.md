# Got the van

After weeks hunting the perfect van, I finally found one.
Well we're far from the perfect, I was tired and really wanted to start.

It's a Renault Master L2H2, the engine seems in relative good state but i wouldn't be
a bad idea to run a check by a professional.

It was sold with some plank, a bedspring and some multilayer isolation.
The seller already had put the floor and some isolation under.

The sheet metal it's another story, i didn't really check well and I didn't saw all the rust.

# The Rust

Iâ€™ve discovered the rust hidden under putty and some weird resin.

The weird resin very hard to remove, on the top of the van,

And what a surprise, or not, i discovered under the shitty stuff.

So i started to list what i had to do before being able to work on the inside part:

- i've to sand every part that as serious rust on it of:
    - the top.
    - the side.
    - the doors inside/outside.
- put some product for the rust.
- fix the hole with epoxy and glass fiber.
- paint every worked parts.
- change all lock.
- repair the middle door that open with difficulty.
- repair the broken door handle.
- check what is under the floor what isolation and what state is the steel sheets.

See you for [day one of work!](/van/day1/)
